## Our Mission
> "The human brain has 100 billion neurons, each neuron connected to 10 thousand other neurons. Sitting on your shoulders is the most complicated object in the known universe." - Michio Kaku

Neural dynamics is a complex field of study that aims to detail how information is transmitted and processed throughout systems of interconnected neurons. Oftentimes, the application of rigorous methods is required to develop models that detail a neural system.

As a team, we aspire to develop modernized software utilities that allow for neural models to be created, visualized and analysed in a robust and clever fashion. We are pioneering the development of powerful tools for the future of neuroscience and computational biology more broadly.

## Introducing Eduspike

Eduspike allows for users to discover popular and relevant spiking neuron models in a sandbox style environment. Through a powerful visualisation module, built-in IDE and accompanying python library, we provide users a hands on experience with popular models such as the LIF and the Hodgkin Huxley neurons.

As an [open-source project](https://github.com/NeurospikeDev/neurospike/tree/main/eduspike), we would love to develop a community around this tool. Please visit our ["Join the team"](/join-the-team) page to find out how to contribute.

<!-- 1. Provide immersive visualizations for neuron models, allowing for better intuition to be gained around their biophysical mechanisms.

2. Think of new ways we can interact with neuron models beyond mathematics and coding.

3. Allow for simulation data to be accessed quickly and  -->
