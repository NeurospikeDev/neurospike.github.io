## Our Mission
> "The human brain has 100 billion neurons, each neuron connected to 10 thousand other neurons. Sitting on your shoulders is the most complicated object in the known universe." - Michio Kaku


Neural dynamics is a complex field of study that aims to detail how information is transmitted and processed throughout systems of interconnected neurons. Oftentimes, the application of rigorous methods is required to develop models that detail a neural system.

As a team, we aspire to develop modernized software utilities that allow for neural models to be created, visualized and analysed in a robust and clever fashion. We are pioneering the development of powerful tools for the future of neuroscience and computational biology more broadly.
